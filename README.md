# Software-Testing-Swaglab

This site is a simulation of a lab where many experiments are done, this lab is a product selling site aka online store It contains a lot of bugs that help software testers to train scanning, detect errors and write a report on them. In this project, a manual test is performed to check the major and minor functionality of the site considering performance and security. All test cases and scenarios are linked to them, made to be as clear, short and specific as possible. Certainly, error reports for all failed cases are included bidirectional with test case and scenario. All this is contained within the manual test excel file. 

For automated testing, I was limited to the Sort Filter test which is an important and essential part of any online store
I used the Selenium Webdriver framework which supports website testing which allowed me to write easy and powerful coding for automated testing.
